## Challenges

Some challenges I faced while working on this project were mainly focused around SQL. Working with the pivot table was challenging since this was my first exposure to it. Working with it involved creating a lot of joins during my queries which made gathering, creating, deleting and especially updating data in the database particularly challenging. Learning Sequelize on top made the process complex and a great learning experience. Although there were many hours simply staring at the tables trying to figure out what I wanted to do and how to do it, by the end I believe I learned the most working on this project than any other.

## Future Development

I would like to expand on this project with more functionality and more routes. Since this is just the backend for a website I could see myself developing the frontend one day as well for a fully functional e-commerce website.

## Conclusion

SQL is a powerful tool that has great potential for running backend servers. This project was a great introduction to using it with Javascript for a fully functional backend but also showed how I have only scratched the surface. In a real world development environment I could see many more tables and relationships between them all which would take careful planning and experience to navigate.
